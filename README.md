# LARN
Please download the processed model input file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NVzG8RwEKiyk-dMIFUOicELLEQhMAFh8/view?usp=sharing). We cannot share the original NOW corpus since it's proprietary.

To train and evaluate RMN and LARN, please use `baseline_model.ipynb` and `our_model.ipynb` respectively. The main requirement is Python 3 and PyTorch.

More instructions would be updated later.
